# Learning a new language

## My process for learning a new language

#### 1. Start by learning by translation using a language I am familiar with, such as Ruby, and comparing similarities and differences.

#### 2. Use various resources to find out how to use the basics such as:
* Language documents
* Exercises or challenges
* Demonstration videos

#### 3. Do basic exercises to gain familiarity.

#### 4. Complete challenges I have done before in another language such as FizzBuzz and Airport challenge and try to complete them in the new language.

#### 5. Attempt new challenges in the new language to test what I have learned.

#### 6. Try to show another person what I have learned and understood to consolidate learning.


## My steps for learning JavaScript

### 1. Learn by translation
I started by comparing the differences and similarities between Ruby and JavaScript with my pair partner.

We started by listing the fundamentals of Ruby that we had come across:

* Arrays and hashmaps
* Strings and integers
* Classes, methods and objects
* Instances
* Comparators
* Booleans
* Print/puts
* User input
* Variables
* Loops/Conditionals
* Testing

### 2. Research and use a variety of resources
I used the following to help with my understanding:

* Mozilla docs (MDN): this was helpful with explaining the fundamentals of JavaScript
* Stack Overflow

I also attended a workshop on debugging using JavaScript. This really helped with my understanding of isolating issues by gaining visibility using console.log(). My code for the Debugging Workshop is [here](https://github.com/anhnguyenis/debugging_js).

Similarly, I attended a workshop on control of flow of code. This helped me understand how to control the flow of code.

### 3. Complete basic exercises
To grasp the fundamentals of JavaScript, I completed the JavaScript Basics task and the [JavaScripting workshopper](https://github.com/workshopper/JavaScripting). My solutions to the JavaScripting workshopped is [here](https://github.com/anhnguyenis/JavaScripting)

### 4. Practise using previous challenges
I then moved onto attempting familiar challenges that I had completed in Ruby but instead using JavaScript. I started with the fizzbuzz challenge which helped me practice TDD with JavaScript and getting familiar with the structure of the syntax and matchers required. This is my code for the [FizzBuzz Challenge](https://github.com/anhnguyenis/fizzbuzz_js).

I then progressed onto the Airport Challenge. This is my code for the [Airport Challenge](https://github.com/anhnguyenis/airport_js).

### 5. Approach a new exercise to test learning
Once familiar with JavaScript I moved onto the [Thermostat Challenge]. I managed to write the logic for controlling a thermostat using JavaScript TDD. I then created an interface[Thermostat Challenge](https://github.com/anhnguyenis/thermostat_js). My next steps were then to link the logic to the interface. I did some styling using some basic CSS.

### 6. Talk it through and explain it to someone
I was able to talk through the Thermostat Challenge with my pair partner and found it helpful to explain my understanding of things to consolidate my learning. Working with my pair, we were able to write the majority of the logic to get the Thermostat to set an initial temperature, increase and decrease the temperature and set limits. I was able to instruct my pair using the driver-navigator style to practise our Javascript TDD.

## Reflections

I found that the best way for myself to learn a new language was to briefly read through the basics using a language document and then to start practising with basic exercises to understand the nuances. I found that I could build on my understanding by knowing how I previously solved a problem such as FizzBuzz, as I already knew what I wanted to do, I just needed to find a way to do it. This definitely sped up my learning as I could spend my time focusing on figuring out how to write and run code rather than how to solve a user story.
