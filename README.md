# Learning a new language

## My process for learning a new language

1. Start by learning by translation using a language I am familiar with, such as Ruby, and comparing similarities and differences.

2. Use various resources to find out how to use the basics such as:

* Mozilla docs: MDN
* Codecademy
* Stack Overflow

3. Do basic exercises to gain familiarity

4. Complete challenges I have done before in another language such as FizzBuzz and Airport challenge and try to complete them in the new language.

5. Attempt new challenges in the new language.


## My steps for learning JavaScript

1. I started by comparing the differences and similarities between Ruby and JavaScript with my pair partner.

We started by listing the fundamentals of Ruby that we had come across:

* Arrays and hashmaps
* Strings
* Classes and methods

2. We used the following to help us with our understanding:

* Mozilla docs: this was helpful with explaining the fundamentals of JavaScript

I also attended a workshop on debugging using JavaScript. This really helped with my understanding of isolating issues by gaining visibility using console.log(). My code for the Debugging Workshop is [here]](https://github.com/anhnguyenis/debugging_js).

Similarly, I attended a workshop on control of flow of code. This helped me understand how to control the flow of code.

3. To grasp the fundamentals of JavaScript, I completed the JavaScript Basics task and the [JavaScripting workshopper](https://github.com/workshopper/JavaScripting). My solutions to the JavaScripting workshopped is [here][JavaScripting](https://github.com/anhnguyenis/JavaScripting)

4. I then moved onto attempting familiar challenges that I had completed in Ruby but instead using JavaScript. I started with the fizzbuzz challenge which helped me practice TDD with JavaScript and getting familiar with the structure of the syntax and matchers required. This is my code for the [FizzBuzz Challenge](https://github.com/anhnguyenis/fizzbuzz_js).

I then progressed onto the Airport Challenge. This is my code for the [Airport Challenge](https://github.com/anhnguyenis/airport_js).

5. Once familiar with JavaScript I moved onto the [Thermostat Challenge]. I managed to write the logic for controlling a thermostat using JavaScript TDD. I then created an interface[Thermostat Challenge](https://github.com/anhnguyenis/thermostat_js). My next steps were then to link the logic to the interface. I did some styling using some basic CSS.

## Reflections

I found that the best way to learn a new language was to briefly read through the basics using a language document. Then to start practicing with basic exercises to understand the nuances. I found that I could build on my understanding by knowing how I previously solved a problem such as FizzBuzz, as I already knew what I wanted to do, I just needed to find a way to do it. This definitely sped up my learning as I could spend my time focusing on figuring out how to run code rather than what to name functions or methods to solve a user story.
